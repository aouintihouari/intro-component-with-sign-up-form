## What I Learned

While working on this challenge, I improved my understanding of:

- Responsive design with `@media` queries.
- Handling client-side form validation in JavaScript.
- Using CSS to style error states dynamically.

Hereâ€™s an example of JavaScript used for form validation:

```javascript
function isValidEmail(email) {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return emailRegex.test(email);
}
```
